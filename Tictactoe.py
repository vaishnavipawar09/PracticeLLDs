# Tic tac Toe
# Clarifying questions

#Is it strictly a 3x3 board or should we support NxN? 3x3
# Players take turn marking x and o, and 
# first to win three symbols in a row (horixontal, vertical, diagonally) wins the game
#If all cells are filled, ends in draw
#displays the grid and allow to make move
# should handle turns automatically, and validate the moves
# Detect and announce winner or draw at the end of game

# âœ… Verbal Design Pitch: Tic Tac Toe
# We are designing a 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game between two players (X and O).
# Players take alternate turns placing their symbol on the grid.
# The game should:
# - Display the current board
# - Handle turns and prevent invalid moves
# - Detect and announce winner (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
# - End in a draw if the board is full and no one wins
# We will implement four classes:
# 1. Player - holds player name and symbol (X or O)
# 2. Board - manages the 3x3 grid and win/draw logic
# 3. Game - handles game loop and player interaction - sets up and starts the game
#If this plan aligns with the expectations, I will proceed with the implementation of the system
