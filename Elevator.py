# üõó Clarifying Questions: Elevator Control System
# 1. Building Layout:
#    ‚Äì How many floors (N) and how many elevator cars (M) are we modeling?
# 2. Capacity & Constraints:
#    ‚Äì What is the maximum passenger capacity per car?
#    ‚Äì Should we model weight limits or just rider counts?
# 3. Request Types:
#    ‚Äì Do we need both external (hall) calls and internal (car-panel) requests?
#    ‚Äì Can passengers cancel a request before pickup?
# 4. Scheduling Policy:
#    ‚Äì Which dispatch strategy? (e.g., nearest-car first, lookup table, collective control)
#    ‚Äì Should idle cars return to a ‚Äúhome‚Äù floor when unused?
# 5. Concurrency & Safety:
#    ‚Äì Must multiple threads handle simultaneous button presses and car movements?
#    ‚Äì Any emergency mode (fire service, priority override)?
# 6. Door & Timing:
#    ‚Äì How long do doors stay open? Do we need explicit door-open/close events?
# 7. Fault Handling:
#    ‚Äì Do we need to handle an out-of-service car?
# 8. Extensibility:
#    ‚Äì Future features: express elevators, VIP mode, load balancing?

# ‚úÖ Verbal Design Pitch: Elevator Control System
# We are building a control system for M elevator cars serving N floors.
# Core responsibilities:
# - Model each Elevator car‚Äôs state (current floor, direction, queued requests)
# - Accept hall-calls (source_floor ‚Üí destination_floor) and dispatch the ‚Äúbest‚Äù car
# - Process each car‚Äôs internal queue in FIFO order, simulating movement and door stops
# - Ensure thread‚Äêsafe request enqueueing and worker threads per car
#
# Key Classes & Methods:
# 1. Direction (Enum)
#    ‚Ä¢ UP or DOWN to indicate travel direction
#
# 2. Request
#    ‚Ä¢ source_floor, destination_floor
#    ‚Ä¢ Encapsulates a pickup + drop-off in one object
#
# 3. Elevator
#    ‚Ä¢ id, capacity (max concurrent requests), current_floor, current_direction
#    ‚Ä¢ requests: List[Request] ‚Äì a FIFO queue of pending rides
#    ‚Ä¢ lock, condition: synchronize add_request and get_next_request
#    ‚Ä¢ add_request(request): under lock, enqueue if capacity allows, then notify worker
#    ‚Ä¢ get_next_request() ‚Üí blocks until a request is available
#    ‚Ä¢ process_requests(): loop forever, pop each request and call process_request()
#    ‚Ä¢ process_request(req): step floor by floor toward destination, update current_floor and direction, simulate travel
#    ‚Ä¢ run(): entrypoint for the worker thread ‚Üí calls process_requests()
#
# 4. ElevatorController
#    ‚Ä¢ elevators: List[Elevator]
#    ‚Ä¢ On init, spins up one thread per Elevator.run()
#    ‚Ä¢ request_elevator(src, dst): picks optimal car (smallest |src - current_floor|) and add_request()
#    ‚Ä¢ find_optimal_elevator(src, dst): simple nearest-car dispatch strategy
#
# Thread Safety:
# - Each Elevator has its own lock+condition so multiple cars can run in parallel
# - Controller only reads elevator.current_floor under no lock; in real system, would need synchronization
#
# Extensions (not shown):
# - Support cancellation of requests
# - Use separate up/down queues and priority scheduling (SCAN algorithm)
# - Handle ‚Äústop at intermediate floors‚Äù for multi-passenger rides
# - Emergency override, door-open timing, fault detection

Whenever you need to always pull out the ‚Äúsmallest‚Äù (earliest) element, a min-heap is the right choice:

O(1) peek of the next execution time: heap[0] is always the smallest timestamp.

O(log n) insertion/removal: pushing a new task or popping the next‚Äêdue one costs logarithmic time‚Äîmuch better than a sorted list (O(n) inserts) or rescanning an unsorted list (O(n) finds).

In contrast, for the per-elevator FIFO queue we used a simple Python list (appending is amortized O(1)),
because each elevator‚Äôs capacity is small and bounded‚Äîso the occasional O(n) pop-from-front is acceptable. 
In a high-scale system you‚Äôd swap that for collections.deque to get true O(1) pops on both ends.
