# üîç Clarifying Questions:
# 1. Package Model:
#    ‚Äì What metadata does each package have? (e.g., name, version, list of dependency names)
# 2. Repository:
#    ‚Äì Where do we fetch packages from? (assume a simple in-memory repository for now)
# 3. Versions:
#    ‚Äì Do we need to handle multiple versions or just one ‚Äúlatest‚Äù per package?
# 4. Operations:
#    ‚Äì Must support install(name), uninstall(name), list_installed()
#    ‚Äì Should uninstall cascade and remove unused dependencies?
# 5. Dependency Semantics:
#    ‚Äì If A depends on B, install(B) first. Detect and error on cycles.
# 6. Persistence:
#    ‚Äì Is installed-state persisted across runs? (we‚Äôll keep an in-memory set)
# 7. Concurrency:
#    ‚Äì Will multiple installs run in parallel? (assume single‚Äêthreaded CLI)

# ‚úÖ Verbal Design Pitch:
# We‚Äôre building a simple package installer that:
#  ‚Ä¢ Knows about available packages (Repository)
#  ‚Ä¢ Resolves dependencies via topological sort (DependencyResolver) 
"""
We do this by building a directed graph of ‚ÄúA ‚Üí B‚Äù edges and performing a topological sort. 
That both (a) guarantees you install in the correct order and (b) detects cycles (so you don‚Äôt try to install things that depend on each other forever).
"""
#  ‚Ä¢ Installs in correct order (Installer)
#  ‚Ä¢ Tracks installed packages (PackageManager facade)
"""
In the LLD we just walked through:

Repository holds the metadata for ‚Äúwhat packages exist and what they depend on.‚Äù
DependencyResolver runs a DFS to gather all needed packages, then Topological sort to produce a valid install sequence or throw a cycle error.
Installer runs the per-package ‚Äúinstall‚Äù or ‚Äúuninstall‚Äù steps.
PackageManager is our fa√ßade (and singleton) that ties it all together: you call pm.install("MyApp"), it resolves, installs in the right order, skips already-installed items, and keeps track of the final state.
This is essentially what apt, yum, pip, npm, or brew do in the wild‚Äîjust with a lot more edge-cases (version constraints, remote fetching, transaction rollbacks, caching, etc.).

 We build a Repository of packages A, B, C, D, E with a simple dependency graph.
